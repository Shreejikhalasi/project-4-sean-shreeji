# Project-4
In this project we have implemented and compared two algorithms that solve the budgeted time-maximization problem. For one algorithm we use the dynamic pattern. This algorithm creates a cache of the “best” (highest time-per-cost) ride item that fits within the budget and keeps selecting ride items from that cache. For the second algorithm we use the exhaustive pattern, which is far slower that the dynamic algorithm. Specifically, among all subsets of rides, the exhaustive algorithm returns the subset whose cost in dollars fits within the budget and whose time is the largest. Comparing both the algorithms and their time complexity, we elaborate and demonstrate the extent that the dynamic algorithm outperforms the exhaustive algorithm.
